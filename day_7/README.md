# Day 7

Brute force FTW!

## Part 1
1. Create a binary tree with left path at each node being an addition operation and the right path being a multiplication operation.
2. Perform DFS on the binary tree to determine if a child node is the target.

## Part 2
1. Refactor binary tree into a trie tree with the middle path being a concatenation operation.
2. Perform DFS on the trie tree to determine if a child node is the target.
