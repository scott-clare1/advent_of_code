# Day 4

Some pretty horrific programming here...

## Part 1

Iterate through every combination of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal checking for `XMAS` or `SAMX`.

Count every occurence.

## Part 2

Iterate through grid finding any `A` character - get all corners of 3x3 grid centered by `A` character.

Validate that diagonals in grid are opposing letters, e.g., if upper left is `M` then bottom right must be `S`.
